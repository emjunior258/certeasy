# Contributing
Here is everything you need to know about the Certeasy Community.

## Contributor types

### Ocasional contributor
Anyone can submit a Merge-Request anytime, there is no formality for that.

### Permanent contributor
Permanent contributors are part of the Certeasy Committee, which makes all the decisions about the project. Permanent members are leaders of the project and have the following responsibilities:

* Contribute actively to the next milestone
* Own code (Code owner)
* Review merge requests
* Issue Triage - analyze issues and ensure that their categorization is appropriate
* Particiapte in Long-term decisions and propose features to be added to the roadmap
* Participate in project governance decisions
* Community support - helping users with their questions or issues, either through forums, chat channels, or other support platforms
* Mentorship and Onboarding -  mentor and onboard new contributors

Permanent Contributors are part of a Microsoft teams community named _Certeasy-Committee_.

If you want to be a permanent contributor of the project you should submit a request [here](https://forms.gle/6eAgcEe4LgMzQ8Zn7).

## Discussions
Any topic that needs to be discussed with the community MUST be posted into the [discussions section](https://github.com/emjunior258/certeasy/discussions). This includes:

* Suggestions of new features
* Ideas of improvement

Project permanent contributors have the ultimate saying in discussions.
Dicussions might evolve into Meetings in order to accelerate closure.

## Meetings
_Virtual Meetings_ might take place for any of the following reasons:
* To clarify topics that are not clear
* To accelerate decisions
* To onboard new members
* To plan a release

Permanent contributors are required to attend to project bi-weekly meetings.

The links for Virtual Meetings are shared in the Certeasy Committee group.
